		<h1>Greg Callahan, recent CS Grad</h1>
		
		<p>"Welcome to my website! My name is Greg, and I'm a recent computer science graduate with a passion for exploring the possibilities of technology. I'm excited to share my skills and experiences with you here.<p/>
		<p>Throughout my education, I gained a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and computer systems. I have applied these skills in various projects and internships. My experiences in the field have only strengthened my curiosity and passion for exploring the ever-changing landscape of computer science.<p/>
		<p>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm also interested in Sci-fi and fantasy fiction, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance and brings fresh perspectives to my work.<p/>
		<p>On this website, you'll find examples of my work and projects, as well as my thoughts on the latest trends and technologies in computer science. I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and continuing to learn and grow in this exciting field."<p/>
